One component is `Unreachable` when Kiali receives a 4xx or 5xx response code when calling to the component's service.

The component service url is specified in the https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[Kiali CR]. Make sure that Kiali has access to that URL.
