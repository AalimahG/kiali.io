If you are interested in adding one more component to the Istio Component Status tooltip, you have the option to add one new component into the https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L484[Kiali CR].

For each component there, you will need to specify the `app` label of the deployment's pods, the namespace and whether is a core component or add-on.
