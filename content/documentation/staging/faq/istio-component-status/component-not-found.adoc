The first thing you should do is check into the Kiali CR for the `component_status` field. See the FAQ that shows link:#where-find-config[the specific settings for this feature].

What Kiali does is look for a Deployment which its pods have the `app` label with the specified value in the CR and live in that namespace.
The `app` label name may be changed form the default (app) and it is specified in this https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L642[field] in the Kiali CR.

Ensure that you have specified correctly the namespace and that the deployment's pod template has the specified label.
