The Travel Demo application has a database service used by several services deployed in the *travel-agency* namespace.

Let's imagine an hypothetical scenario: at some point of the lifecycle of the application, the telemetry shows that the database service degrades and starts to increase the average response time.

This is a very common situation and in this case database specialist suggests that data are growing and the original indexes design needs to be updated.

Our database specialist is suggesting two approaches and proposes to prepare two versions of the database service to test which may work better.
