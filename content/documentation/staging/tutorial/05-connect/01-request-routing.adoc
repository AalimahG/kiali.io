The Travel Demo application have several portals deployed on the *travel-portal* namespace consuming a *travels* service deployed on the *travel-agency* namespace.

The *travels* service is backed up by a single workload called *travels-v1* then it receives requests from all portal workloads.

At a moment of the lifecycle the business needs of the portals may differ and new versions of the *travels* service may be necessary.

This step will show how to route request dynamically to multiple versions of the *travels* service.

NOTE: *[1]* Deploy *travels-v2* and *travels-v3* workloads

To deploy the new versions of the *travels* service follow the steps:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/travels/travels-v2.yaml) -n travel-agency
kubectl apply -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/travels/travels-v3.yaml) -n travel-agency

</a>

{nbsp} +
As there is no specific routing defined, when there are multiple workloads for *travels* service the requests are uniformly distributed.

NOTE: *[2]* Investigate the http headers used by Travels Demo application

The link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#routing-rules[Traffic Management] features of Istio allow to define link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#match-condition[Matching Conditions] for dynamic request routing.

In our scenario we would like to perform the following routing logic:

- All traffic from *travels.uk* routed to *travels-v1*
- All traffic from *viaggi.it* routed to *travels-v2*
- All traffic from *voyages.fr* routed to *travels-v3*

Portal workloads use HTTP/1.1 protocols to call the *travels* service, so one strategy could be to use the HTTP headers to define the matching condition.

But, where to find the HTTP headers ? That information typically belongs to the application domain and we should examine the code, documentation or dynamically trace a request to understand which headers are being used in this context.

There are multiple possibilities, the Travel Demo application uses a link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/annotations/[Istio Annotation] feature to add an annotation into the Deployment descriptor to add additional Istio configuration into the proxy.

</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
In our example the link:https://github.com/kiali/demos/blob/master/travels/travels-v2.yaml#L15[HTTP Headers] are added as part of the trace context.

Then tracing will populate custom tags with the *portal*, *device*, *user* and *travel* used.

NOTE: *[3]* Use the Request Routing Wizard on *travels* service to generate a traffic rule

    <img src="/images/tutorial/05-01-travels-request-routing.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" />
</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
In the first rule, we will add a Request Matching for *portal* header equals to *travels.uk* value.

Use "Add Match" button to update the "Matching selected" for this rule.

    <img src="/images/tutorial/05-01-add-match.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" />
</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
Move to "Route To" tab to update the destination for this "Request Matching".

Use the "Add Rule" to create the first rule.

    <img src="/images/tutorial/05-01-route-to.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" />
</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
Add similar rules to route traffic from *viaggi.it* to *travels-v2* workload and from *voyages.fr* to *travels-v3* workload.

When the three rules are defined you can use "Create" button to generate all Istio configuration needed for this scenario.

</a>

{nbsp} +
The Istio Config linked with a given service can also be located under the "Istio" tab in the Service Details page.

NOTE: *[4]* Verify Request Routing working from the *travels-portal* Graph

Once the Request Routing is working we can verify that outbound traffic from every portal goes all to a single *travels* workload.

If you use the "Find.../Hide..." filter, graph can hide old traffic grey edges for a clear graph.
