In the previous link:../tutorial/#01-request-routing[Request Routing] step we have deployed two new versions of the *travels* service using the *travels-v2* and *travels-v3* workloads.

That scenario showed how Istio can route specific requests to specific workloads, in that case, each portal deployed on *travel-portal* namespace (*travels.uk*, *viaggi.it* and *voyages.fr*) were route to a specific *travels* workload (*travels-v1*, *travels-v2* and *travels-v3*).

This Traffic Shifting step will simulate a new scenario: the new *travels-v2* and *travels-v3* workloads will represent new improvements for the *travels* service that will be used by all requests.

These new improvements implemented in *travels-v2* and *travels-v3* represent two alternatives way to address a specific problem and we would like to test them before to decide which one to use as a next version.

So, in a first moment we will send 80% of the traffic into the original *travels-v1* workload, and will split 10% of the traffic on *travels-v2* and *travels-v3*.

NOTE: *[1]* Use the Traffic Shifting Wizard on *travels* service

Create a scenario with 80% of the traffic distributed on *travels-v1* workload and 10% of the traffic distributed on *travels-v2* and *travels-v3*.

NOTE: *[2]* Examine Traffic Shifting distribution from the *travels-agency* Graph

NOTE: *[3]* Compare *travels* workload and study new changes proposed in *travels-v2* and *travels-v3*

Istio Telemetry is grouped per logical application and that gives an advantage to compare different workloads that are related to one or more services that represent a similar concept.

In our example, we can use the "Inbound Metrics" and "Outbound Metrics" tabs in the *travels* application details, group by "Local version" and compare how *travels-v2* and *travels-v3* are working.

The charts show that the Traffic distribution is working accordingly and 80% is being distributed into *travels-v1* workload and they also show no big differences between *travels-v2* and *travels-v3* in terms of request duration.

NOTE: *[4]* Update or delete Istio Configuration

As part of this step you can update the Traffic Shifting scenario to test different distribution, when finished you can delete the generated Istio config for the *travels* service.
