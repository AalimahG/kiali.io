Distributed systems will benefit from fail quickly and apply back pressure rather than propagate delays an errors through the system.

Circuit breaking is an important technique used to limit the impact of failures, latency spikes or other type of network problem.

This step will show how to apply a Circuit Breaker into the *travels* service to limit the number of concurrent requests and connections.

NOTE: *Step 1:* Deploy a new *loadtester* portal in the *travel-portal* namespace

In this example we are going to deploy a new workload that will simulate an important increase in the load of the system.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/travels/travel_loadtester.yaml) -n travel-portal
----

The *loadtester* workload will try to create 50 concurrent connections to the *travels* service adding a considerable pressure to the *travels-agency* namespace.

The Travels Demo application is capable to handle this load and in a first look it doesn't show unhealthy status.

But in a real scenario an unexpected increase in the load of a service like this may have a significant impact in the overall system status.

NOTE: *Step 2:* Use the Traffic Shifting Wizard on *travels* service to generate a traffic rule

Use the "Traffic Shifting" Wizard to distribute traffic to the *travels* workloads and use the "Advanced Options" to add a "Circuit Breaker" to the scenario.

The "Connection Pool" settings will indicate that the proxy sidecar will rejects requests when the number of concurrent connections and requests exceeds more than one.

{nbsp} +
The "Outlier Detection" will eject a host from the connection pool when there are more than one consecutive error.

NOTE: *Step 3:* Study the behaviour of the Circuit Breaker in the *travels* service

In the *loadbalancer* workload Graph we can see how the Circuit breaker defined on *travels* service allows some connections but it fails on most of them.

Remember, that these connections are stopped by the proxy at *loadbalancer* side, so those calls don't overload the network implementing a "fail sooner" pattern.

Using the Graph we can select the failed edge, check the Flags tab and see that those requests are closed by the Circuit breaker.

</a>

{nbsp} +
If we examine the "Request volume" metric from the "Outbound Metrics" tab we can see the evolution of the requests, and how the introduction of the Circuit Breaker made the proxy reduce the requests volume.

NOTE: *Step 4:* Update or delete Istio Configuration

As part of this step you can update the scenarios defined around the *travels* service to experiment with more Circuit Breaker settings, or you can delete the generated Istio config in the service.
