== What is Kiali?.

Kiali provides answers to the question: What are the microservices in my Istio service mesh doing ?

{nbsp} +
A Microservice Architecture breaks up the monolith into many smaller pieces that are composed together. Patterns to secure the communication between services like fault tolerance (via timeout, retry, circuit breaking, etc.) have come up as well as distributed tracing to be able to see where calls are going.

A service mesh can now provide these services on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks. Routing decisions are done at the mesh level.


icon:lightbulb[size=2x] {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} Kiali works with Istio to visualise the service mesh topology, features like circuit breakers or request rates.

icon:lightbulb[size=2x] {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} Kiali also includes Jaeger Tracing to provide distributed tracing out of the box.


== What does it do?

=== Graph View

Kiali provide a graph view of your namespace in real time, with the number of services and edges, we can see an overview with the inbound/outbound traffic the last minute.

=== Applications

In the applications tab we can see all the apps running in our environment.

[#img-kiali-app-list]
.List of Applications
image::app-list.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
Kiali provide us all the information related with the application like the health.
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-app-view]
.Info of Application
image::app-view-info.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
We can also see the metrics associated with an application provided by grafana
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-metrics]
.Metrics of Application

{nbsp} +

=== Workloads

In the workload tab we have the list of workloads with their health, error rate and labels validations.
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-workload-list]
.List of Workloads
image::workload-list.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
When we choose a workload we can see the information related to it and associated pods and services.

{nbsp} +

=== Services

In the service tab we go to the page detail of a service, we have a health icon to check if our service has some problem like error rate.

In this page we have an overview about the service : labels, type, ip , ports, endpoints, workloads, destiantion rules, virtual services...

We can also visualize the inbound/outbound metrics for this service and go to his grafana dashboard.

=== Istio Config

In the Istio Config tab we have a list with all the istio objects that we have in our environment.

[#img-kiali-istio-list]
.List of Istio Configs
image::istio-list.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
We can inspect the configuration yaml about a specific Istio item
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-istio-valid]
.Valid Configuration of Istio Config
image::istio-yaml.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
Kiali show us the errors in configurations.
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-istio-invalid]
.Invalid Configuration of Istio Config
image::istio-yaml-validation.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +

=== Distributed Tracing

In the distributed tracing tab we can see the Jaeger UI in a new tab to check the traces generated by our resources.
