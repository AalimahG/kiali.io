Private clusters have higher network restrictions. Kiali needs your cluster to allow `TCP` traffic between the Kubernates API service and the Istio Control Plane namespace in both `8080` and `15000` ports. Features like `Health` and `Envoy Dump` won't be workinig as expected.

Make sure that the firewalls in you cluster allow the connections mentioned before.

Check our section of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Private Clusters requirements in the https://kiali.io/documentation/latest/installation-guide/#_google_cloud_private_cluster_requirements[Installation Guide, window="_blank"].

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} Open an https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/new/choose[issue, window="_blank"] if you have a private cluster with a different provider than GKE. We'll try to accomodate your scenario and document it for future users.
