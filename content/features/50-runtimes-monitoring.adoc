Kiali comes with some default dashboards for a couple of runtimes: Thorntail, Vert.x, Spring Boot and Node.js.

These dashboards are simple Kubernetes resources, so you can use your favorite tool to create, modify or delete them.
As they are defined as plain _yaml_ or _json_ files, it's a perfect fit for keeping under source control like GIT, track changes, share, etc.

Check out the link:/documentation/runtimes-monitoring/[documentation page] to learn more about it.
